# Introduction

In this project, we will build a compiler in python starting from the basic steps (such as splitting the expressions into tokens) all the way up to being able to completely compile a program.

# Steps:

### 1. Scanner: splitting expression into a sequence of tokens

In this first step we will implement a scanner that will split our expression into a sequence of tokens according to their types.

### 2. AST: representing an expression as a tree

In this second step we will implement a composite like datastructure to represent expressions as trees.

### 3. Parser: converting string expressions into trees

In this third step we will implement a parser that will convert our expressions in string format to the tree datastructure we implemented in step 2.
